# NoteWrangler
Angular watch us build note taking app

**Getting Started**

*To get you started you can simply clone the NoteWrangler repo and install the dependencies:*

**Install Dependencies**

You will need the latest version of node.js installed to run this sample app, I recommend
Node Version Manager.

Install the server side node libraries we depend upon via npm, the node package manager.
The app has been preconfigured to automatically run bower so simply do:

*npm install*
This creates a node_modules folder which contains the npm packages installed in the previous step

**Run the Application**

We have preconfigured the project with a simple development web server. The simplest way to start this server is:

node app
Now pull up your application at http://localhost:8000/.

npm run debug
This starts the app in debug mode which allows you you to use node-inspector You can open another browser tab at: http://127.0.0.1:8080/debug?port=5858 to get to the web console.
